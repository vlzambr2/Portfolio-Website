                <p class="bio-text">
                    In the last semester of my undergraduate degree, I served as <b>President of <a href="https://cougarcs.com/" style="color:#c8102e">CougarCS</a></b>, the largest student-led 
                    computer science organization at the University of Houston!<br>
                    As President, I led a team of 10+ officers to promote professional development and technical upskilling to 200+ members 
                    by coordinating and hosting club workshops and activities! I oversaw all semester event logistics, drive member recruitment, 
                    and define CougarCS's vision and key objectives. I spearheaded a rebranding effort <img src="../Assets/cougarheadT.png" style="max-width: 3%; padding: 0"> to update CougarCS's outward image, 
                    and bring more attention to the club's subcommittees! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During Fall 2021, I served as Secretary of CougarCS, where I increased new member recruitment by 30% through structured 
                    advertisement of club activities and events, and streamlined the team's process documentation by creating thorough agendas 
                    and taking concise and organized meeting notes. I created and executed the club's most successful event for two consecutive semesters:
                    The <b>Build-Your-Own-Keyboard workshop</b>!<br>
                    During the BYOK workshop, I condensed the hardware skills I learned from my keyboard project into a teachable workshop, where participants 
                    could build their own 4-key binary keyboard (pictured on bottom right) from scratch!<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm so grateful to have had the oppurtunity to lead and give back to the community
                    that contributed so much to my professional growth! I intend to stay involved as an Alumni and continue the success of CougarCS's mission.
